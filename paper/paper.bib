	abstract = {Twenty-six years ago a small committee report, building on earlier studies, expounded a compelling and poetic vision for the future of astronomy, calling for an infrared-optimized space telescope with an aperture of at least 4 m. With the support of their governments in the {US}, Europe, and Canada, 20,000 people realized that vision as the 6.5 m James Webb Space Telescope. A generation of astronomers will celebrate their accomplishments for the life of the mission, potentially as long as 20 yr, and beyond. This report and the scientific discoveries that follow are extended thank-you notes to the 20,000 team members. The telescope is working perfectly, with much better image quality than expected. In this and accompanying papers, we give a brief history, describe the observatory, outline its objectives and current observing program, and discuss the inventions and people who made it possible. We cite detailed reports on the design and the measured performance on orbit.},

	abstract = {The Fine Guidance Sensor ({FGS}) is one of the four science instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope ({JWST}). {FGS} features two modules: an infrared camera dedicated to fine guiding of the observatory and a science camera module, the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph ({NIRISS}) covering the wavelength range between 0.7 and 5.0 μm with a field of view of 2.2' X 2.2'. {NIRISS} has four observing modes: 1) broadband imaging featuring seven of the eight {NIRCam} broadband filters, 2) wide-field slitless spectroscopy at a resolving power of rv150 between 1 and 2.5 μm, 3) single-object cross-dispersed slitless spectroscopy enabling simultaneous wavelength coverage between 0. 7 and 2.5 μm at Rrv660, a mode optimized for transit spectroscopy of relatively bright (J {\textgreater} 7) stars and, 4) sparse aperture interferometric imaging between 3.8 and 4.8 μm enabling high­ contrast ("' 10-4) imaging of M {\textless} 8 point sources at angular separations between 70 and 500 milliarcsec. This paper presents an overview of the {FGS}/{NIRISS} design with a focus on the scientific capabilities and performance offered by {NIRISS}.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the envisaged setup and changes to the current Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes ({MAST}) configuration at the beginning of operations for the James Webb Space Telescope mission. The placing of the observatory at L2 and long periods of autonomous operations mean that observations can be split over several time periods or `visits'. Data are processed through standard science data reduction pipelines after arriving at the Space Telescope Science Institute ({STScI}). We describe how data from visits and pipeline processing lead to the data products that are to be stored in the archives. Most observations will require a number of exposures; we discuss the data associations that will formulate the highest level of pipeline products that will be available in the {MAST} archive for {JWST}. The {JWST} observatory has numerous spectroscopic modes, including integral field units and multiple object spectra which will distinguish it from the Hubble Space Telescope archive. We describe the expected data products and services. Finally, we discuss the links to data analysis software and archive products available for user reprocessing.},
