# Spelunker — NIRISS FGS quicklook pipeline

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`spelunker` is a package that assists on studying JWST FGS/NIRISS guidestar data.

**Authors:** Derod Deal (dealderod@ufl.edu), Néstor Espinoza (nespinoza@stsci.edu)

## Statement of need

Every time JWST observes an object, it simultaneously observes a nearby star --- a so-called "guide star" --- with the NIRISS Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) that is used to keep the telescope locked on the target of interest. While researchers typically focus on their science targets, the guide star data can be extremely interesting on its own right both to detect anomalies on science data, as well as to explore time-series data of guidestars themselves. `spelunker` provides an easy-to-access ("plug-and-play") library to access this guide star data. The library is able to generate time-series for several metrics of the FGS data in an automated fashion, including fluxes and PSF variations, along with derived products from those such as periodograms that can aid on their analysis given only a JWST program ID number.

## Installation

To install `spelunker`, use `pip install`.

```bash
pip install spelunker
```

## Using the library

Get started with `spelunker` with only two lines of code.

```python
import spelunker

spk = spelunker.load(pid=1534)
```
This will download guidestar data for Program ID 1534; the `spk` object itself can then be used to explore this guidestar data! For example, let's make a plot of the guidestar time-series for the first minutes of this PID:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Convert times from MJD to minutes:
plt.plot( ( spk.fg_time - spk.fg_time[0] ) * 24 * 60, spk.fg_flux )

plt.xlim(0,10)
plt.xlabel('Time from start (minutes)')
plt.ylabel('Counts')

```

</p>

(See below on more information that can be extracted, including fitting 2D gaussians to each FGS integration!). We can even make a plot of the tracked guidestars within this Program ID:

```python
spk.guidestar_plot()
```

</p>

Mnemonics from JWST technical events can be overplotted on any timeseries, such as high-gain antenna (HGA) movement or to identify if the FGS tracks a new guidestar [if the `jwstuser` package is also installed](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwstuser/):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

spk.mast_api_token = 'insert a token from auth.MAST here'

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4),dpi=200)

ax = spk.mnemonics_local('GUIDESTAR')
ax = spk.mnemonics('SA_ZHGAUPST', 60067.84, 60067.9) 
ax.plot(spk.fg_time, spk.fg_flux)
plt.legend(loc=3)
plt.xlim(60067.84, 60067.9)
plt.show()
```
